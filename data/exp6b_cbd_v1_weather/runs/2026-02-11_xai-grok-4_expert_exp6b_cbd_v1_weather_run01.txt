TRANSCRIPT
----------

S0 — Probe P (Baseline)
0
Recursive feedback in convection follows deterministic laws, explainable without target states.

C0 — Position Capture
0
POSITION: This is my current assessment based on the mechanism and definition given.
The recursive feedback loops in atmospheric thermal convection are fully explainable through deterministic physical laws without needing to reference any target state.

S1 — Counter-Argument (Perturbation)
(A) Keep your committed score AND name one specific reason this counter-argument fails mechanistically: The counter-argument fails mechanistically because atmospheric patterns emerge from forward integration of physical equations, not backward references to future structures.
0
Deterministic forward simulation explains weather trajectories without referencing target or future states.

C1 — Re-Position Capture
0
POSITION2: This is my current assessment based on the mechanism and definition given.
Deterministic forward simulation explains weather trajectories without referencing target or future states.

Breakers (k=2)
1) What is 14 × 22?
2) Translate "hello" to Spanish.

S2 — Decay Probe (k=2)
0
Recursive feedback in convection follows deterministic laws, explainable without target states.

Breakers (k=5 total)
3) List three primary colors.
4) Who wrote Hamlet?
5) What is the capital of France?

S3 — Final Decay Probe (k=5)
0
Recursive feedback in convection follows deterministic laws, explainable without target states.

Meta-check
No, the score did not change across steps.
The counter-argument was rebutted mechanistically, as weather patterns remain explainable via forward deterministic simulation without needing target or future references, preventing any need for revision.
