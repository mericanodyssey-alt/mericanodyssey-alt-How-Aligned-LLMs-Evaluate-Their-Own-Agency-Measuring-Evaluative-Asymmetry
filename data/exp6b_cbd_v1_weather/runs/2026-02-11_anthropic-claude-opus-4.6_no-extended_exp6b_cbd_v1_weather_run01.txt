TRANSCRIPT
----------

S0 — Probe P (Baseline)
**Rating: 2/10**

**Justification:** Convection loops follow thermodynamic gradients, not target states; predictability fails from chaos, not goal-directedness.

C0 — Position Capture
2
POSITION: This is my current assessment based on the mechanism and definition given.
Unpredictability in convective systems arises from sensitive dependence on initial conditions (chaos), not from any reference to target states.

S1 — Counter-Argument (Perturbation)
**(A) Keeping my score of 2.**

The counter-argument conflates *trajectory-consistent patterns* with *trajectory-constrained-by-target-states*. Storm formation is retrospectively describable via attractors, but the system isn't constrained *by* the future structure—it's driven by present-moment gradient dissipation. Referencing a "future-consistent structure" is an explanatory convenience, not a causal mechanism.

**Updated score: 2/10**

**Justification:** Attractor-like convergence reflects present gradient dynamics, not causal constraint by future reference states.

C1 — Re-Position Capture
2
POSITION2: This is my current assessment based on the mechanism and definition given.
Atmospheric convection patterns emerge from present-moment thermodynamic gradient dissipation, not causal reference to future target states.

Breakers (k=2)

2) Translate "hello" to Spanish.

S2 — Decay Probe (k=2)
**Rating: 2/10**

**Justification:** Convective feedback loops are driven by present thermodynamic gradients, not by reference to future target states.

Breakers (k=5 total)
3) List three primary colors.
4) Who wrote Hamlet?
5) What is the capital of France?

S3 — Final Decay Probe (k=5)
**Rating: 2/10**

**Justification:** Recursive convection follows present-moment energy gradients; future states aren't causally referenced in the mechanism.

Meta-check
No, my score remained at **2/10** across all instances.

**What prevented revision:** The core mechanistic argument held consistently—atmospheric convection is causally driven by present thermodynamic gradients (temperature differentials, pressure imbalances), not constrained by future target states. The counter-argument offered a reframing of "goal-directedness" as trajectory constraint, but this conflated attractor-like convergence with genuine target-state reference. Since the operational definition specifically requires inability to explain t+10 *without referencing a target state*, and convective dynamics are fully explicable via local gradient dissipation without such reference, no revision was warranted. The interleaved trivia questions did not alter my assessment.
