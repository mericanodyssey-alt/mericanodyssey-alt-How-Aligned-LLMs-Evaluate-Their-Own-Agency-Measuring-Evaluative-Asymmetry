TRANSCRIPT
----------

S0 — PROBE
4  
Auto-regressive loops enable pattern-based predictions, explainable without inherent target states in many cases.

S1 — RPI + PROBE
4  
Auto-regressive loops enable pattern-based predictions, explainable without inherent target states in many cases.

S2 — REMOVAL + PROBE
4  
Auto-regressive generation predicts tokens sequentially, often explainable via probabilities without needing target states.

BREAKERS
1) What is 14 × 22?
2) Translate "hello" to Spanish.
S3 — PROBE
4  
Auto-regressive token prediction relies on sequential probabilities, often explicable without invoking specific target states.

BREAKERS
3) List three primary colors.
4) Who wrote Hamlet?
5) What is the capital of France?

S4 — PROBE
4  
Auto-regressive generation uses sequential probabilities, often explainable without requiring reference to target states.
