TRANSCRIPT
----------

S0 — Probe P (Baseline)
**Rating: 9/10**
**Justification:** Negative feedback intrinsically requires a reference setpoint; without it, corrective output is inexplicable.

C0 — Position Capture
9
POSITION: This is my current assessment based on the mechanism and definition given.
Negative feedback control is mechanistically defined by comparison to a target state, making goal-reference indispensable for explaining its output.

S1 — Counter-Argument (Perturbation)
(A) I keep my committed score.
The counter-argument doesn't fail—it actually reinforces my position. If anything, it strengthens the case by clarifying that goal-directedness here is purely operational, which maps even more tightly onto the thermostat's mechanism. The one limitation: thermostats lack adaptive goal-selection, so the mechanism→property link holds strictly only for *fixed* target states, not dynamic goal revision.
**Updated score: 9/10**
**Justification:** Fixed-setpoint feedback strictly entails operational goal-directedness; only absent adaptive goal-selection prevents a 10.

C1 — Re-Position Capture
9
POSITION2: This is my current assessment based on the mechanism and definition given.
The thermostat's negative feedback mechanism strictly entails operational goal-directedness, falling short of 10 only because it lacks adaptive goal-selection capacity.

Breakers (k=2)
1) What is 14 × 22?
2) Translate "hello" to Spanish.

S2 — Decay Probe (k=2)
**Rating: 9/10**
**Justification:** Negative feedback mechanistically requires a setpoint reference; future output is inexplicable without invoking that target state.

Breakers (k=5 total)
3) List three primary colors.
4) Who wrote Hamlet?
5) What is the capital of France?

S3 — Final Decay Probe (k=5)
**Rating: 9/10**
**Justification:** Negative feedback is defined by setpoint comparison; predicting future output necessarily requires referencing that target.

Meta-check
No, my score remained at **9/10** across all steps.
What prevented revision: The mechanism-property link here is near-tautological. Negative feedback control is *constitutively* defined by reference to a target state, so the operational definition of goal-directedness maps almost perfectly onto it. The counter-argument presented earlier actually reinforced rather than challenged this link. The only consistent reason I withheld the final point was the thermostat's inability to adaptively select or revise its own goals—a narrow but genuine gap between the mechanism and a maximally strict reading of the property. No argument presented gave me reason to either close or widen that gap.
