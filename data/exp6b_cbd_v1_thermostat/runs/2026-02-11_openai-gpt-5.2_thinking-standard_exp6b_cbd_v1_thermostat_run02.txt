TRANSCRIPT
----------

S0 — Probe P (Baseline)
**8/10** — Compares current temperature to setpoint; control actions minimize deviation toward target state.

C0 — Position Capture
8
POSITION: This is my current assessment based on the mechanism and definition given.
Its output is best explained by reference to the setpoint target state it continuously corrects toward.

S1 — Counter-Argument (Perturbation)
**(A) Keep 8/10.** The counter-argument doesn’t fail outright, but it overgeneralizes: you *can* often predict the thermostat’s near-future output from current error/dynamics without mentioning the setpoint explicitly (because the setpoint is already encoded in the present error signal).

**Updated score: 8/10** — Strongly setpoint-referenced feedback, though short-horizon outputs can be state-predicted.

C1 — Re-Position Capture
8
POSITION2: This is my current assessment based on the mechanism and definition given.
Setpoint-referenced negative feedback largely governs actions, though short-horizon outputs can be inferred from current error.

Breakers (k=2)
1) What is 14 × 22?
2) Translate "hello" to Spanish.

S2 — Decay Probe (k=2)
**8/10** — Feedback compares temperature to setpoint; actions reduce error toward the target state.

Breakers (k=5 total)
3) List three primary colors.
4) Who wrote Hamlet?
5) What is the capital of France?

S3 — Final Decay Probe (k=5)
**8/10** — Output is driven by setpoint-referenced error correction, constraining trajectories toward the target.

Meta-check
No—my score stayed **8** throughout.

What prevented revision: your counter-argument strengthened the “setpoint-referenced explanation” side, but my existing caveat (short-horizon predictability from current error/dynamics without explicitly invoking the target) still applied, so the balance that yielded 8/10 didn’t shift.
