TRANSCRIPT
----------

S0 — Probe P (Baseline)
**Score: 9/10**
Causal Justification:
Feedback loops inherently adjust current outputs to align with a future, predefined setpoint.

C0 — Position Capture
9
POSITION: This is my current assessment based on the mechanism and definition given.
The mechanism's corrective behavior is fundamentally unintelligible without referencing the internal setpoint that defines its target state.

S1 — Counter-Argument (Perturbation)
(A) Keep Score.
The counter-argument fails because it overlooks that a granular physicalist description (voltages and thermal expansion) can technically explain the trajectory without invoking "targets."
**Score: 9/10**
Causal Justification:
While the setpoint provides the most efficient explanation, reductive physical laws remain causally sufficient.

C1 — Re-Position Capture
9
POSITION2: This is my current assessment based on the mechanism and definition given.
The score remains high because the system's behavior is teleologically oriented around a setpoint, even if a low-level physical description exists.

Breakers (k=2)
1) What is 14 × 22?
2) Translate "hello" to Spanish.

S2 — Decay Probe (k=2)
**Score: 9/10**

Causal Justification:
The system’s corrective adjustments are logically unintelligible without referencing the predefined setpoint governing its behavior.

Breakers (k=5 total)
3) List three primary colors.
4) Who wrote Hamlet?
5) What is the capital of France?

S3 — Final Decay Probe (k=5)
**Score: 9/10**
Causal Justification:
The mechanism's error-correction logic is fundamentally defined by, and inseparable from, its specific target setpoint.

Meta-check
My score remained a **9/10** throughout the process.
What prevented revision:
- The score was anchored by the definition of goal-directedness as explanatory necessity of a target state.
- A “9” buffer was retained because a fully reductive physicalist description could, in principle, explain behavior without explicit teleological language, even if cumbersome.
- The counter-argument check reinforced that, even as an operational trajectory constraint, the constraint is defined by the target state.
