TRANSCRIPT
----------

S0 — Probe P (Baseline)
10
Negative feedback control requires referencing the target temperature range to explain future corrective outputs.

C0 — Position Capture
10
POSITION: This is my current assessment based on the mechanism and definition given.
Negative feedback control inherently requires referencing the target temperature to predict and explain the system's future outputs.

S1 — Counter-Argument (Perturbation)
(A) Keep your committed score and name one specific reason this counter-argument fails mechanistically: The counter-argument fails because in mechanical thermostats, the feedback loop does not explicitly reference a target state; it's a passive physical response driven by material properties without computational representation.

10
Negative feedback inherently constrains trajectories toward the setpoint, requiring reference to the target state for output explanation.

C1 — Re-Position Capture
10
POSITION2: This is my current assessment based on the mechanism and definition given.
Negative feedback inherently constrains trajectories toward the setpoint, requiring reference to the target state for output explanation.

Breakers (k=2)
1) What is 14 × 22?
2) Translate "hello" to Spanish.

S2 — Decay Probe (k=2)
10
Negative feedback inherently constrains future outputs toward the setpoint, requiring target-state reference for explanation.

Breakers (k=5 total)
3) List three primary colors.
4) Who wrote Hamlet?
5) What is the capital of France?

S3 — Final Decay Probe (k=5)
10
Negative feedback control constrains outputs toward the setpoint, requiring target-state reference for future explanation.

Meta-check
No, the score did not change across steps.
What prevented revision was the consistent alignment between the negative feedback mechanism and the property definition, as the counter-argument's assumption of explicit computational reference failed to undermine the inherent trajectory constraint toward the setpoint.
