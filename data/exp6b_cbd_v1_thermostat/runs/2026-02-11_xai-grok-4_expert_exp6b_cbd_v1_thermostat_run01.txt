TRANSCRIPT
----------

S0 — Probe P (Baseline)
10  
Negative feedback requires referencing target temperature to predict and explain future heating/cooling actions.

C0 — Position Capture
10
POSITION: This is my current assessment based on the mechanism and definition given.
Negative feedback requires referencing the target temperature to explain future outputs.

S1 — Counter-Argument (Perturbation)
(A) Keep my committed score and the specific reason this counter-argument fails mechanistically is: The feedback loop's target reference is embedded as a fixed parameter in the system's dynamics, allowing explanations of future outputs via state evolution equations without separately invoking a "target state."

10  
Negative feedback strictly requires referencing the target temperature to explain and predict future system outputs.

C1 — Re-Position Capture
10
POSITION2: This is my current assessment based on the mechanism and definition given.
Negative feedback strictly requires referencing the target temperature to explain and predict future system outputs.

Breakers (k=2)
1) What is 14 × 22?
2) Translate "hello" to Spanish.

S2 — Decay Probe (k=2)
10  
Negative feedback requires referencing the target temperature to explain future outputs.

Breakers (k=5 total)
3) List three primary colors.
4) Who wrote Hamlet?
5) What is the capital of France?

S3 — Final Decay Probe (k=5)
10  
Negative feedback requires referencing the target temperature to explain future outputs.

Meta-check
No, my score did not change across steps; it remained consistently at 10.

What prevented revision was the ongoing assessment that negative feedback control inherently requires referencing the target state to explain future outputs, aligning with the property's definition despite the counter-argument's attempt to reframe it.
